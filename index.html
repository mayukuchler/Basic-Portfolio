            <p>
            My name is Mayu and I am originally from Los Angeles, California.  I moved to Miami five years ago to attend to study Criminology at the University of Miami. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    I currently live in Brickell with my best friend, Martha, and our two pets. We have a pomeranian named Logan and a cat named Lucy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    I am currently working at Apple in the Genius Bar where I offer customers technical support for their devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am learning how to code in order to further my career with the company and eventually land a corporate position as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to take this class and learn a new language.
